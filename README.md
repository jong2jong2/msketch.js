M.Sketch (http://msketch.kaist.ac.kr) is a prototyping tool to support non-experts in designing and building a linkage-based mechanism. It enables users to rapidly create the mechanism by blending bottom-up (drawing linkages) and top-down (optimizing movement path) approaches. The resulting movement can be reviewed on the fly in a 3D space. Functions for digital fabrication with laser cutting and modular kits allow users to easily and effectively transform the designed mechanism into a physical model. M.Sketch can be used for technical non-experts to prototype initial models of smart product, robots, toys, and kinetic sculptures.

MSKETCH.js is a part of M.Sketch software, it enables to calculate linkage-based mechanism based on BÃ¤cher et al. (2015)'s Symbolic Reconstruction algorithm (https://doi.org/10.1145/2766985).
